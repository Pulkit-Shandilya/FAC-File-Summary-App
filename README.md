# Excel Summary Tool

A high-performance desktop application for comparing .fac files and generating detailed Excel summaries of differences.

## üöÄ Features

- **75x Performance Optimization** - Dramatically faster than traditional file comparison methods
- **Professional Desktop GUI** - User-friendly interface with real-time progress tracking
- **Batch Processing** - Compare multiple file pairs automatically
- **Comprehensive Logging** - Detailed processing logs with timestamps
- **Smart File Detection** - Only creates summary files when differences are found
- **Cross-Platform** - Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux

## üì• Quick Start

### Option 1: Download Executable (No Python Required)
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/CapnBloodBeard/excel-summary-script/releases)
2. Download `gui_app.exe`
3. Double-click to run - no installation needed!

### Option 2: Run from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CapnBloodBeard/excel-summary-script.git
cd excel-summary-script
python gui_app.py
```

## üéØ How It Works

The tool compares two .fac files or folders containing .fac files and generates Excel summaries showing:

- **New Lines** - Data present in File 2 but not in File 1
- **Removed Lines** - Data present in File 1 but not in File 2  
- **Changed Values** - Side-by-side comparison showing `old_value -> new_value`
- **Identical Files** - Logged but no summary file created (saves space)

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface

The desktop application provides:

1. **File/Folder Location 1** - Select source files or folder
2. **File/Folder Location 2** - Select comparison files or folder  
3. **Summary Folder Name** - Choose output location
4. **Real-time Progress** - Live updates during processing
5. **Processing Log** - Detailed information about each file comparison

## üìä Performance

- **Original Processing**: <10ms per row
- **Optimized Processing**: ~0.4ms per
